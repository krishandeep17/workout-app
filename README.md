# React Workout App

Welcome to the React Workout App! This web application provides a comprehensive collection of fitness exercises, allowing you to choose exercise categories and specific muscle groups to browse more than 1000 exercises. With the power of React Router 6 and Swiper, you can seamlessly navigate through exercise listings and experience a dynamic interface. The app also offers exercise details, pulls related videos from YouTube, displays similar exercises, and showcases exercises that use the same equipment. Material UI ensures an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, while the implementation of a skeleton loader minimizes load-time frustration by providing visual feedback during data loading.
